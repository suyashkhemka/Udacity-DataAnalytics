Project 1 - US Bikeshare Data Analysis

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
The Datasets Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year

Software used
Python3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anacoda.
VScode.
Git Bash.

Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset (TMDb movie data)

In this project, I analyzez a dataset and communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do the analysis

This Python script is written for Project 3 (Term 1) of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) and is used to explore TMDb movie data. But what determines if a movie is considered as good or bad? There could be several factors influencig the quality of a movie, as for example the budget, genre, etc. This little project helped the author to improve his data analytics skills and explore some of the success criteria for movies.

First some Data Wrangling was applied, before the data was cleaned in order to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

Potential questions
What are the details of the movie which has the highest and lowest revenue?
What are popular genres across the years and how has it changed?
What is the relation between movie runtime and revenue that it has generated?
